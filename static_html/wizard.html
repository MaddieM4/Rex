<h2>Wizard List</h2>

<h3>Set your IP data</h3>

<p>To set up a hosted URL, fill out <a href="/wizard/_/set">this form</a>. Rex uses the same URL to set and view public IP sets, so the "Set successfully" page <i>is</i> the page where people can go to to see your current connection information (and for that reason, if you try to refresh the page, the browser will try to resend the information, loading the page in POST mode, so you need to click in your address bar and hit enter to get it to load in GET mode, which displays your info. This only affects you if you just set your information, and will not affect other people viewing the page).</p>

<h3>Reserve a URL</h3>

<p>It's not cool if just anyone can set your IP data to anything they want. In fact that's terrible. While we're working to provide more security than just password protection (SSL access and RSA cryptography), we're also in a rush to get this thing out the door now that internet censorship is getting <i>real</i> in the U.S. That's a squeezy yet ill-defined deadline. Anyways, to reserve a named URL as your own and prevent other people from using it, <a href="/wizard/_/claim">set it up here.</a></p>

<h3>Release your reservation</h3>

<p>Erase all your information that's on the server. <a href="/wizard/_/unclaim">Wiiiipe.</a></p>

<h3>Drop your IP data from public hosting</h3>

<p>Leaves your spot reserved, but forgets your IP data. <a href="/wizard/_/unhost">Le wizard</a></p>

<h3>Tell a hosted peer here to try to connect to you</h3>

<p>"Wake" a hosted port on this site to try to connect to your URL. Since hole punching only works when A is trying to talk to B while B is trying to talk to A (they try to talk to each other at the same time), this is critical for connecting to one of your buddies. <a href="/wizard/_/wake">Clicky clicky</a></p>
