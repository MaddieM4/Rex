<h3>Rex root directory</h3>

<p>Rex (short for REndezvous eXchange) is a low-level combination of TCP session maintentance and HTTP RESTful hosting webhooks designed to provide public services to make P2P software easier, both for developers and users. It's very easy to write code that uses Rex servers since it's designed to interface simply and consistently with machines, and it gives your users the ability to pass around their current location as a website address (technically called a URL). And it's a lot easier to tell your friend over the phone to connect to "somerex.com/ip/greg" than try to relay an IPv6 number piece by piece!</p>

<p>TCP and UDP hole punching are the most well-supported ways for people behind a firewall or a router to talk to each other. It requires no fiddling around with router configuration or admin powers, no new features like IPv6 or UPnP, and your own configuration will work on any client computer with any Rex server.</p>

<p>Rex isn't really designed to be messed around with in a browser (HTTP though it is), but for fun and testing purposes, there are a few <a href="/wizard/">wizards</a> in this particular implementation that let you fool around with the hosting facilities (although you're still on your own for the TCP session, which I recommend using a telnet client for).</p>
